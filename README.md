Realtalk

This is a chat application I made to test some things in Rails that I really wanted to try out.

1. Login with Devise (Done)
2. Custom input fields with css animations. (Done)
3. A mailer for user registration etc. (Done)
4. Mobile first design. (Done)
5. Realtime updates with ActionCable and Redis (not yet)

DEMO (https://realtalkchat.herokuapp.com/)
For the demo, I have made some fake users. So, if you don't feel like creating your own user, log in to one of these existing accounts and get straight into sending some messages.

email: test1@test.com, password: test123
email: test2@test.com, password: test123
email: test3@test.com, password: test123 ... and so on, there are 11 in total
